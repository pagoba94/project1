# project1: HappyCo Scuba Diving Trip - HappyCo is organizing a scuba diving day for its employees.

Some employees say that they only go if it is an area where there are no white sharks, others say that there are other sharks much more dangerous, that they should not only think about the white shark. In addition, some women say that they are much more at risk of being attacked, since they have heard that sharks attack women more, especially if they are on their period. 

We will carry out a study with the data provided by to see which species are the most dangerous, ¿is the white shark the most dangerous?, and ¿do they really attack women more? In addition, we will analyze how many attacks end with the death of the person, ¿Are they as dangerous as they seem?

On this repo you will mainly find:
- **data**: stores the data used for the analysis
- **figures**: plots png files
- **src**: stores the src files with all the functions used
- Analysis.ipynb: jupyter notebook file with all the functions and plots used
- exploration2.ipynb and exploration.ipynb: jupyter notebook files with exploration data
- main.py :

Conclusions: 
- White sharks are the most dangerous specie. 
- Sharks do not attack more women, they attack more men. 
- Most of the attacks end up without a fatality.
