## Project Overview
Some employees say that they are only goingif it is an area where there are no white sharks, others say that there are other sharks much more dangerous, that they should not only think only about the white shark. In addition, some women say that they are much more at risk of being attacked, since they have heard that sharks attack women more, especially if they are on their period. 

We will carry out a study with the data provided by to see which species are the most dangerous:
- ¿Is white shark the most dangerous?
- ¿Do they really attack women more? 
- In addition, we will analyze how many attacks end with the death of the person, ¿Are they as dangerous as they seem?

## Dataset:
"Global Shark Attacks" is a table of shark attack incidents compiled by the Global Shark Attack File and it was downloaded with permission from the Global Shark Attack File's website.

## On this repo you will mainly find:
- **figures**: plots created, png files.
- **src**: stores the src files with all the functions used.
- _Analysis.ipynb_: jupyter notebook file with all the functions and plots used.
- _exploration2.ipynb and exploration.ipynb:_ jupyter notebook files with exploration data.
- _main.py:_ python file that creates and saves plots on figures folder.

## Conclusions:
- White sharks are the ones that attack the most, 33.8% from 1.860 attacks analyzed are done by a white shark.
- The species that attack and kill the most are first white shark, second tiger shark and third the bull shark.
- Sharks do not attack more women, they attack much more men.
- Most of the attacks end up without a fatality.
